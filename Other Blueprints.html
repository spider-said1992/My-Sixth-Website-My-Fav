    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
        <br>Do you want to live a better life but feel constrained? Maybe you’re not confident in your capabilities, maybe you’re limited by your environment or people around you. And so you’re stuck in a place that isn’t fulfilling to you. You want to live a different life but you can’t help staying in this comfort zone..
        <br>
        <br> If this sounds like you, don’t you give up breaking out of the loop yet. You can get unstuck where you are and start living the life you truly want.
        </br>
        <br> In this activity sheet, you will understand your own capabilities more and learn how to continuously upgrade your abilities so as to get out of the comfort zone and reach your full potential -- and eventually start living the life you want.
        </br>
    </p>
    <h3>Do You Know That You Are More Capable Than You Thought?
    </h3><br>
    <p> Most of the time, we are capable to achieve a lot of things but we choose to bury outpotential inside of us. Because this is the easiest and safest thing to do -- so we won’t bechallenged, and won’t experience potential failures.
        </br>
        <br> However, if we are willing to tap into your real capabilities and understand our ownstrengths and weaknesses, we will open up new opportunities that can help us break freefrom the rut.
        </br>
        <br> Once we have a clear understanding of what we are and aren’t capable of, we will start tolearn what to do to enhance our strengths and improve our weaknesses.</br>
        <br> As we learn, we expand more than just our knowledge base. Learning can help us step outof a pattern or routine. And, the more we do that, the more confidence we’ll create.
        </br>
        <br> It moves us past that point of complacency, which, in turn, leads us closer to our ideal goaland life.</br>
    </p>
    <h3>Tap into Your Potential And Break out of the Loop (3-Step Guide)</h3>
    <p>
        <br> As explained in the previous section, self understanding is a crucial step to reach your full potential. So here in this 3-step guide, we will dig into what you really want for life and then look into the skills you need to enhance or equip with in order to reach your goal.
        </br>
        <br> In this section, you will learn some of the techniques embedded in our 7 Cornerstone Skills -- Motivation and Learning, which we teach at Lifehack’s Masterclass. With these 2 Cornerstone Skills, you can tackle anything beyond your comfort zone efficiently
        </br>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Step 1: Figure out Your Goal</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>At Lifehack, we teach a method to utilize the Cornerstone Skill Motivation, to help you stay motivated to get what you want. And to do that, you need to set yourself a clear goal. Try to ask yourself these questions to make sure this is the goal you truly want to pursue:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>● What exactly do I want?</b></li>
        <li><b>● Why do I want this?</b></li>
    </ul>
    What do you want from life? What’s your goal? Write it down here:
    <div id="form">
        <form>
            <textarea rows="4" cols="50" name="Message" placeholder="e.g. Open my own coffee shop --Because I love coffee and want coffee lovers to drink quality coffee. I want to share my passion for coffee with others"></textarea>
        </form>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Step 2: Assess Your Personal Inventory</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>With a clear goal of what you want, now you need to identify the skills required to reach the goal.</p>
    <p>
        Do some research, or ask people who have experience or knowledge in this to find out what skills or abilities are necessary to reach that goal. Then, look inward and assess your own abilities.
    </p>
    <p>As you understand your current skills, you can visualize the gap between your current abilities and your target ones. What’s lacking? What can be strengthened?</p>
    <p>At Lifehack, we make use of the Stages of Learning to discover the level of your abilities. Here’re the 3 Stages of Learning:</p>
    <p><b>● Stage 1 Cognitive (Early)</b> — Understanding what you’re trying to do: researching, thinking about the process, and breaking the skill into manageable parts.<br>
        <b>● Stage 2 Associative (Intermediate)</b> — Practicing the task, noticing environmental feedback, and adjusting your approach based on that feedback.<br>
        <b>● Stage 3 Autonomous (Late)</b> — Performing the skill effectively and efficiently without thinking about it or paying unnecessary attention to the process; the skill is completely internalized</p>
    <p>If you have never learned the skill and know nothing about the skill at all, then that skill is at the Stage 0: <strong>Not Yet Started.</strong></p>
    <p>Now, try to rate your own ability based on the skills you identified in Step 2, and see if you have any existing abilities that are somehow related to the skill you intend to learn:</p>
    <table>
        <tr id="one">
            <th>#</th>
            <th>Skill</th>
            <th>Stage of Learning</th>
        </tr>
        <tr id="two">
            <td>e.g</td>
            <td>How to make the latte art</td>
            <td>0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <th>.................................................</th>
            <th>.................................................</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <th>..................................................</th>
            <th>..................................................</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <th>..................................................</th>
            <th>..................................................</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4</td>
            <th>..................................................</th>
            <th>..................................................</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5</td>
            <th>..................................................</th>
            <th>..................................................</th>
        </tr>

    </table>

    <p>Don’t get discouraged if you’re still at the very early (or not yet started) stage for most of these skills</p>
    <p><strong>Knowing where you are at the moment is only the beginning of making a better version
            of yourself</strong></p>
    <p>This table is only an overview of your current capabilities. The next step is to learn the efficient way to take up the skills you lack and break free from your limitations.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Step 3: Create a Learning Feedback Loop</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Just like all the skills you must learn -- learning on its own is also a skill. To keep your learning sharp, you need to invest in improving your methods of learning</p>
    <p>In other words, your learning skill should never stay static. What you’re learning right now is just a foundation -- and it’s up to you to keep building it up. For instance, strengthening your current skills from Stage 0 to Stage 1, or from Stage 1 to Stage 2 etc.</p>
    <p>When it comes to learning, you try, you gain experience, you learn from it, and you try again. And each time, you’re improving and making progress. Everytime you repeat this learning process, you’re going through something called a Feedback Loop. You’ll have to go through multiple feedback loops before confidently executing the skill</p>
    <p>What separates a fast learner from a slower learner is not some innate, natural talent. Instead, the fast learner understands how to effectively use their Feedback Loop to speed up the learning process.</p>
    <p>To make sure your Feedback Loop is effective, you will have to look at 3 key factors:</p>
    <h4>I. Consistency</h4>
    <p>Being consistent means having a regular way to get the same quality of feedback. You need to be able to compare every practice or learning experience in order to measure, learn and make adjustments.</p>
    <p>If your feedback is not consistent, then you’re going to have a hard time knowing what went wrong or what went right</p>
    <h4>II. Speed</h4>
    <p>The best forms of feedback are almost instantaneous. The shorter the time it takes for one Feedback Loop to complete, the better. This is because you’ll have more attempts, which means more improvements within the same timespan.</p>
    <p>The key to getting fast feedback is to take the skill or knowledge and <b>break it down.</b> Try to breakdown the skill into different components. They could be broken down into steps,
        <b>subskills or processes</b>, or even <b>by difficulty</b></p>
    By Steps
    <p>
        Let’s think about the skill that you intend to learn; can it be broken down by steps?</p>
    <div id="form">
        <form>
            <textarea rows="4" cols="50" name="Message" placeholder="E.g. Learning to cook
1. finding fresh ingredients
2. food prep and handling
3. preparing sauces
4. serving and plating"></textarea>
        </form>
    </div>
    By Sub-Skills / Processes
    <p>Or can it be broken down by sub-skills/processes?</p>
    <form>
        <textarea rows="4" cols="50" name="Message" placeholder="E.g. Learning to use professional photo editing software
1. Edit lighting / exposure
2. Portrait/people image touchup
3. Environment / scenery image touchup
4. Add special effects to images..."></textarea>
    </form>
    By Difficulty
    <p>Or can you scale it down to something simple and ramp up the difficulty over time?</p>
    <form>
        <textarea rows="4" cols="50" name="Message" placeholder="E.g. Learning to juggle 5 balls
1. Juggle 2 balls with two hands
2. Juggle 2 balls with one hand
3. Juggle 3 balls with two hands
4. Juggle 4 balls --- 2 balls with each hand..."></textarea>
    </form>
    <h4>III. Accuracy</h4>
    <p>To get accurate feedback, we have to have a way of measuring it.</p>
    <p>Quantifying is a way to accurately measure your performance. It means attaching a number to it. This helps to give objectivity and consistency when comparing your current performance with your previous performance.</p>
    <p>Quantifying feedback can give you constructive information that will help you improve during each cycle of the feedback loop. These numbers we use to quantify feedback are called
        <b>Metrics.</b></p>
    <p>Here’re some common examples of formats that metrics may take:</p>
    <p>
        As a Quantity
        <ul>
            <li> Number of mistakes made or successful attempts</li>
            <li> e.g. Able to juggle 5 balls at once</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        As a Ratio
        <ul>
            <li> Ratio of successes attempts</li>
            <li> e.g. 10 onions chopped per minute</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        As a Time
        <ul>
            <li> How long an attempt lasts, or by when it can be done</li>
            <li> e.g. Being able to hold a yoga tree pose from 10 minutes to 20 minutes</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Now, can you think about some metrics to get accurate feedback?</p>
    <form>
        <textarea rows="4" cols="50" name="Message" placeholder="E.g. Learning to make latte art -- As a quantity: able to create a basic heart-shaped latte
art within 10 minutes"></textarea>
    </form>
    <h4>Bonus Tip: Ask for External Feedback</h4>
    <p>The right External Feedback can help you accelerate your learning and avoid costly periods of trial and error. It only comes at the cost of relying on someone else to help you.</p>
    <p>This means that finding the right person to give External Feedback is essential. You are looking for experience in the form of a coach or mentor who can provide critical guidance.</p>
