    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p>Your definition of success is unique to you. In this worksheet, we’ll tackle just how to pinpoint
        the areas in your life that seem to be holding you back from your success.</p>
    <p>We do this by first outlining what you really want in life. Next, we’ll dig deeper into what’s
        preventing you from getting what you want.</p>
    <p>Each question's answer will be relevant to the following question, so please complete them
        in the order given.</p>
    <h3>THE CHECKLIST</h3>
    Answer each question in the boxes provided
    <ol>
        <li>What does success look like to you?</li>
        <div id="form">
            <form>
                <textarea rows="4" cols="50" name="Message" placeholder="Message"></textarea>
            </form>
            <li>What would it take for you to feel successful?</li>
            <p>This is not the time to be modest—really think about how your life would be different if you
                were reaching your full potential</p>
            <div id="form">
                <form>
                    <textarea rows="4" cols="50" name="Message" placeholder="Message"></textarea>
                </form>
                <li>What's on your bucket list?</li>
                <p>Most of us have "bucket lists". These are lists of goals that we'd like to accomplish in our
                    lifetime.</p>
                <div id="form">
                    <form>
                        <textarea rows="4" cols="50" name="Message" placeholder="Message"></textarea>
                    </form>
                    <li>Think of a goal that you want to accomplish. Why do you want to
                        accomplish this goal? How will your life improve if you accomplish
                        this goal?</li>
                    <div id="form">

                        </form>
                        <li>What do you think is holding you back from reaching these
                            goals?</li>
                        <p>In general, there are two types of potential blockers: Internal - limiting beliefs about your self
                            or your potential and External - actual conditions in your environment that prevent you from
                            reaching your potential</p>
                        reaching your potential</p>
