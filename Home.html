    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Are you tired of the same day-in day-out life? Do you feel stuck in a rut or trapped in an endless loop but can’t seem to break free?<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        It can be frustrating to hear about how to make your life wonderful by doing things that you can’t necessarily do on a daily basis because of your job and daily demands. Maybe you’re the breadwinner of the family, or maybe you have to fulfill plenty of responsibilities…</p>
    <p>
        You can live the life you truly want while still fulfilling your responsibilities and expectations.<br> In this activity sheet, you will learn how to turn your life around and start living a fulfilling life</p>
    <b>
        <h2>How to Break out of the Loop</h2>
    </b>
    <p>Limitations are the things that keep you constrained inside a loop. They keep you stuck facing the same problems, having the same choices, and taking the same actions over and over, and over again.</p>
    <p>
        Some people are stuck due to circumstances, but for many people, they stay in the loop because it’s their <b>comfort zone</b>-- where everything feels safe, easy and certain. When you’re so safe in this comfort zone, you can’t really find a reason to step out of it.</p>
    <p>
        The first essential step to breaking out of the loop is to <b>work on the way you think.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        At Lifehack, our <b>4-Pillar Breakthrough Framework</b> helps people shift their paradigms and consistently turn any limitation into an opportunity that is achievable.
    </p>
    <p>The following steps are built upon this Framework and will help you break free from the loop and design the life you want</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Step 1: Find Your Hidden Opportunities</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>In life, you will always have constraints of some sort. It’s you who decide whether they become your limitations. Every obstacle has a hidden opportunity. Instead of fighting them or resigning yourself to them, see that there are two sides to every coin.<br> So if you want to break free from where you are, train your mind to think of opportunities instead of limitations. And this is what the 1st Pillar is about -- <b>an opportunity is a turning point that can create a break through.</b><br>
        <p>All you need is to get the right focus and <b>know exactly what is limiting you right now</b>-- not anything in the past or future. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>I’m limited by</strong> my busy work schedule <strong>because</strong> it leaves me no time to spend with my family.</li>
            <li><strong>It stops me from</strong> having a close relationship with my wife and my kid.</li>
            <li><strong>If only I could </strong>manage my time better, <strong>then I’d be able to</strong> spend more quality time with my family.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>See how limitations can be turned into opportunities? The last statement is the opportunity statement. Now it’s your turn to come up with your opportunity statement:</p>
    </p>
    <p>Now it’s your turn to come up with your opportunity statement:</p>
    <div id="form">
        <form>
            <textarea rows="4" cols="50" name="Message" placeholder="I'm limited by ... [ the obstacle/constraint ] Because ... [ why it's a limitation ]
It stops me from ... [ the thing you want to do ]
If only I could ... [ the achievement ] then I'd be able to ... [ the new possibility ]"></textarea>
        </form>
    </div>
    <p>Once you’re clear about what you truly want and what’s stopping you, you’ll be more driven to move forward as you now have a direction on how to turn your limitations into opportunities. And, this is when you can start to think about what you can do to achieve that
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Step 2: Flesh outIdeas What You Can Do</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>After realizing your hidden opportunities, it’s time to come up with exactly what you can do about these opportunities. And this comes to the 2nd Pillar -- planning your progression towards what you want.<br> Let’s take the father’s opportunity statement “If only I could manage my time better, then I would spend more quality time with my family.” as an example; it helps him to reflect about what he can really do to achieve the goal:<br>
        <div id="form">
            <form>
                <textarea rows="4" cols="50" name="Message" placeholder="● Set a clear time to stop working
● Discuss about my workload with my manager
● Schedule time to play with my son every day after work, or during weekend
● Schedule date nights with my wife
● No work during family dinner"></textarea>
            </form>
        </div>
    </p>
    <p>See how many possible ways to achieve his goal with a clear opportunity statement?
    </p>
    <p>Now, it’s your turn to reflect about what you can do to achieve what you want:
    </p>
    <div id="form">
        <form>
            <textarea rows="4" cols="50" name="Message" placeholder="write it here "></textarea>
        </form>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Step 3: Restructure Your Lifestyle</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        After brainstorming a list of things you can do to achieve your goal, create a concrete plan to make these things happen.<br>
        <p>Here, the 3rd Pillar comes into place --
            <strong>invest your energy consciously.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>As the breadwinner for your family or yourself, it may be hard to fit all these new tasks into your already busy schedule. And so, reviewing your current lifestyle is necessary before trying to fit in anything new.<br>
        </p>
        <p>At Lifehack, our Cornerstone Skill Time is dedicated to helping you master your time. One of the essential frameworks to help organize and prioritize your time is the <b>Superstructure Method.</b><br>
        </p>
        <p>To help you start living your purpose, we can use a simplified version of the Superstructure Method<br>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Review the roles you play in life and decide each role’s Must Haves tasks --</strong>tasks that are absolutely critical to do; without it, the outcome is meaningless.</p>
        <p>As you’re looking into your daily schedule, keep these questions at the back of your mind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                What must be kept as a breadwinner?
            </li>
            <li>
                What should be ditched or changed in order to get closer to your true Purpose?
            </li>
        </ul>

        <b>For example:</b><br>
        <p>
            The father who wants his wife and his son to be happy every day discovers that he has 3 roles to play: as the breadwinner, a father, and a husband.</p>
        <p>
            He finds out that he’s been working too many hours -- a lot more hours than necessary even as the breadwinner. He works over time every day to just to get more compensation. This has allowed him little time to spend with his family</p>
        <p>
            So he has decided to ditch working extra hours every single day and fit in date night with his wife and play time with his son every other day.</p>
        <p>This is how his new schedule looks like:
        </p>
        <p>
